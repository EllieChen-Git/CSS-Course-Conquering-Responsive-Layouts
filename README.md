#### Concepts

- **HTML/CSS by default is responsive**: It's us (as developers) to insert some code incorrectly that takes away the responsiveness.

- **em**: 'em' always looks for the font size of the container. If you didn't set one, by default the browser’s font size is 16px. So if you set 'padding: 5em', it will be '80px (16px \* 5)'.

#### 0413 - 01 Percentage vs Fixed Widths

- Use '%' instead of 'fixed widths': Block elements by default are 100% of their parent.

#### 0413 - 02 Paddings vs Fixed Heights

- Use 'padding' instead of 'fixed heights'
